This is a bit involved at the moment, because you need to have a development version of GHC, 
as well as having a bootstrapping version of GHC to build it with.

So, on Ubuntu, 

sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev ghc libopenssl-ruby
sudo gem install rake open4 rspec hoe
cabal install c2hs
wget http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/current/dist/ghc-6.11.20090907-src.tar.bz2
tar -jxvf ghc-6.11.20090907-src.tar.bz2
cd ghc-6.11.20090907
# adjust the argument to -j to your number of cores, and the prefix if you need to install somewhere else
sh boot && ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local && make -j 4 && sudo make install
cd ..
git clone git://github.com/mwotton/Hubris.git
cd Hubris
rake
# here's where you'll see a whole lot of successes, if you're very lucky
# There's a good chance you won't. Tell me what went wrong and i'll fix the docs.
